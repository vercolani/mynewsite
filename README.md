## Dear Family,

A year ago I started to lose weight and felt tired after breakfast which I could not understand. I went to my doctor, who ran some blood tests that showed there were some issues with my kidneys. My Nephrologists (kidney doctor) did an ultra sound on my kidneys that showed they were performing just fine so he did a special blood test. When I got the results, I recorded it on a spreadsheet and looked up the items on the test that where high/above normal. I wanted to understand what was going on with my body.

The word Myeloma kept coming up many times. I Googled Myeloma and found out it is a rare form of cancer (about 30,000 new cases a year) that affects the cells in your bone marrow with survival rates from 2 to 5 years, depressing! [Donâ€™t get worried, I already did that for you. Read the rest.] So I had to see an Oncologist / Hematologist.

After the doctor read the current blood tests I was informed that there are two phases to Myeloma: an active phase and an inactive phase. The Oncologist seemed sure that it was the inactive type called MGUS (Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance). More test were ordered which determined that I am in the beginning stages of MGUS.

While MGUS in time will turn into active Myeloma, it can take years. They will start to monitor my blood every six months to watch for any changes in the state of my MGUS. Until such a time as something changes there are no worries and there is no medicine or treatment for MGUS.

While the MGUS testing was being performed by specialists my regular doctor performed some blood tests and informed me yesterday that I now also have Type 2 Diabetes. [When it rains it pours.] Type 2 diabetes is age related. I eat correctly and exercise, my body either does not make enough insulin or does not use it properly. I have another blood test scheduled in August to determine what course of treatment is advised: pills, injection, or a combination of medications.

I just wanted to let you all know at the same time. I plan on doing whatever necessary so I can live a long life and continue to aggravate the shit out of all of you. I love you all very much. I will keep you informed. Until then you now know as much as I. If you want to know more, you can Google [Myeloma](https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/blood-cancers/myeloma), [MGUS](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-serious-is-mgus) and [Type 2 diabetes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193).
